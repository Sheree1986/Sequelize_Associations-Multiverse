# Sequelize Association
- This lesson builds an ORM of the tables we created in the [SQL Lesson](https://github.com/ElvisGarcia079/SQL-Multiverse) for: 
1. Products
2. Customers
3. Orders

- We cover creating a Model for these 3 tables, establishing their associations, and testing your code as we go along!
